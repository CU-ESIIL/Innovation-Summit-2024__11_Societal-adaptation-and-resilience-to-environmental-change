## Research Question: Innovation for Inclusion or Computation (approx. time: 5-10 mins)
Write the research question your team selected in the space below. Feel free to revise the original question.


- Can we find patterns in a hot/arid climate for societal adaptation and resilience? (water)

- Societal Adaptation/Resilience to Environmental Change: What is the response of human societies to past and present environmental challenges and how mught they respond in the future?



## Project Title (approx. time: 5-10 mins)
Craft a catchy title for your team’s project. Think of something that would grab attention at a conference or in a headline.

-  Using Arizona to observe the relationships/feedback loops between water, land, and people.


## Promoting Resilience and Adaptation
Describe how your proposed project aligns with the Summit's themes of resilience and adaptation. Please provide 1-2 sentences that clearly connect your project's goals or methods to these themes.

## Choosing Big Data Sets
Explore potential data sets for your project's topic from the [data library](https://cu-esiil.github.io/data-library/). List your options below, organizing them by whether they represent the system you're studying (e.g., deciduous forests) or the disruption to it (e.g., wildfire). Then discuss your choices and indicate your final selections.

### Draft Potential Data Sets
  - **System Being Perturbed/Disrupted:**
    - [List all potential data sets here]
  - **Perturbator/Disrupter:**
    - [List all potential data sets here]

### Final Choice
  - **System Being Perturbed/Disrupted (Final Choice):**
    - [Indicate your final selected data set here]
  - **Perturbator/Disrupter (Final Choice):**
    - [Indicate your final selected data set here]



## Brief Check-in: Definition of Resilience (approx. 5 mins)
Below is a working definition of the word "Resilience" for the Summit. Please edit the definition below based on your earlier discussion and chosen project.

*"Resilience is the capacity of a system, community, organization, or individual to absorb stress, recover from disruptions, adapt to change, and continue to develop and thrive."*

- [Edit or reaffirm this definition here]


## Day 1 Report Back
Select one representative from your group to present your proposed project. For the report back, each group will have 30-60 seconds to present their responses to the questions below. Keep it concise and focused. This is just a quick oral presentation - you will not be able to use slides/images.

- **Project Title:**
  - [Insert your team's project title here]
- **Research Question:**
  - [Insert your team's refined research question here]
- **Selected Data Sets:**
